# Jisho Tomo

Jisho Tomo is a Japanese <=> English dictionary Android app.

Jisho Tomo was created as part of the Android Developer Nanodegree program by Udacity and Google.

## Database

There is a companion [Rails app](https://github.com/sienatime/jmdict-rails) also on GitHub but it's a bit of a mess. It was designed to produce the .sqlite file
that is present in this repository. 

## Attributions

This app uses the [JMdict dictionary files](http://www.edrdg.org/jmdict/j_jmdict.html).

These files are the property of the [Electronic Dictionary Research and Development Group](http://www.edrdg.org/),
